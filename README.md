This repository represents all materials related to my learning of Solana Ecosystem, RUST porgramming language and RPC calls and communications with Solana Network using Typescript/web3.js library and many others.

-  In `another-one-bytes-the-rust` folder there are two files for now. One is `theory.md` where I wrote what I learnt from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) documentation about simplest RUST concepts and syntax by my words.
`core.rs` is a compilable RUST code where I tested everything that is described in `theory.md` (except modules, nothing to test for now, vanilla theory).
    Some elaboration exists in `core.rs` too.
- In `lab` there are only typescript codes (not compilable as my test keypairs aren't available for the viewer), showcases of the labs of [SolanaDev Courses](https://solana.com/developers/courses) labs
- `SolanaOPS.pdf` will be the diagrammical visualisation of how is Solana designed on it's architectural level. Some information about Accounts is shown here, but it is not done yet
